    "paragraph": "During the 20th century there was a vast increase in the variety of music that people had access to. Prior to the invention of mass market gramophone records (developed in 1892) and radio broadcasting (first commercially done ca. 1919\u201320), people mainly listened to music at live Classical music concerts or musical theatre shows, which were too expensive for many lower-income people; on early phonograph players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, using sheet music, which required the ability to sing, play, and read music. These were skills that tended to be limited to middle-class and upper-class individuals. With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of songs and musical pieces from around the globe. purchase enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of Classical music symphonies and operas that a much wider range of the population would not be able to hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in a much wider range of the population region.\nSound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because Sound recording enabled recordings of songs and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide. The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including vinyl records, compact cassettes, compact discs (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, digital audio recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the mid-1990s , of audio and video recordings via the Internet, using file sharing of digital audio recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the globe . The introduction of multitrack recording in 1955 and the use of mixing had a major influence on pop and rock music, because The introduction of multitrack recording in 1955 and the use of mixing enabled record producers to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance. The development of sound recording and audio engineering technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the Musique concr\u00e8te (1949) and acousmatic(1955) schools of electronic composition. In the 1970s, African-American hip hop musicians began to use the record turntable as a musical instrument, creating rhythmic and percussive \"scratching\" effects by manipulating a vinyl record on the turntable.\nThe 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than The 20th-century orchestra predecessors and used a much wider variety of instruments. In Beethoven's and Felix Mendelssohn's time in the 19th century, The 20th-century orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler, the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer. Saxophones were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as Vaughan Williams' Symphonies No.6 and 9 and William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. Twentieth-century orchestras generally include a string section, woodwinds, brass instruments, percussion, piano, celeste, harp(s), with other instruments called for occasionally, such as electric guitar and electric bass.\nthe 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles. Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of altered chords and extended chords in 1940s-era Bebop jazz. The development of powerful, loud guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement systems in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show. Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of jazz and rock music to create jazz fusion). As well, composers and musicians used new electric, electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices. In the 1980s, some styles of music, such as electronic dance music genres such as house music were created largely with synthesizers and drum machines. Faster modes of transportation such as jet flight allowed musicians and fans to travel more widely to perform or hear shows, which increased the spread of musical styles.",

However, modernism in music became increasingly prominent and important; among the most important modernists were Alexander Scriabin, Claude Debussy, and post-Wagnerian composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss , who experimented with form, tonality and orchestration. Busoni, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, and Schreker were already recognized before 1914 as modernists, and Ives was retrospectively also included in this category for Ives challenges to the uses of tonality. Composers such as Ravel, Milhaud, and Gershwin combined classical and jazz idioms.",

Later, minimalism was adapted to a more traditional symphonic setting by composers including Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams. Minimalism was practiced heavily throughout the latter half of the century and has carried over into the 21st century, as well as composers like Arvo P\u00e4rt, Henryk G\u00f3recki and John Tavener working in the holy minimalism variant.

    "paragraph": "For centuries, instrumental music had either been created by singing, or using mechanical music technologies, such as drawing a bow across a string that is strung on a hollow instrument or plucking taught gut or metal strings (string instruments), constricting vibrating air (woodwinds and brass) or hitting something to make rhythmic sounds (percussion instruments). In the early twentieth century, electronic devices were invented that were capable of generating sound electronically, without an initial mechanical source of vibration. As early as the 1930s, composers such as Olivier Messiaen incorporated electronic instruments into live performance. While sound recording technology is often associated with the key role sound recording technology played in enabling the creation and mass marketing of popular music, new electric and electronic sound recording technology was used to produce art music, as well. The musique concr\u00e8te (French: \u201cconcrete music\u201d), developed about 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Schaeffer associates, was an experimental technique using recorded sounds as raw material.\nIn the years following World War II, some composers were quick to adopt developing electronic technology. Electronic music was embraced by composers such as Edgard Var\u00e8se, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Milton Babbitt, Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono, Herbert Br\u00fcn, and Iannis Xenakis. In the 1950s the film industry also began to make extensive use of electronic soundtracks. Major rock groups that were early adopters of synthesizers include The Moody Blues, The Beatles, The Monkees, and The Doors.",

    "paragraph": "Folk music, in the original sense of the term as coined in the 18th century by Johann Gottfried Herder, is music produced by communal composition and possessing dignity, though by the late 19th century the concept of \u2018folk\u2019 had become a synonym for \u2018nation\u2019, usually identified as peasants and rural artisans, as in the Merrie England movement and the Irish and Scottish Gaelic Revivals of the 1880s. Folk music was normally shared and performed by the entire community (not by a special class of expert or professional performers, possibly excluding the idea of amateurs), and was transmitted by word of mouth (oral tradition).\nIn addition, folk music was also borrowed by composers in other genres. Some of the work of Aaron Copland clearly draws on American folk music.\nAn important work on registering traditional tunes of the Balkanic region was that of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k since B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k is probably the first composer who was interested in recording audios as well as analysing audios from an ethnological point of view.",

    "paragraph": "Bluegrass music is a form of American roots music, and a related genre of country music. Influenced by the music of Appalachia, Bluegrass has mixed roots in Irish, Scottish, Welsh, and English traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of African-Americans through incorporation of jazz elements.\nSettlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland arrived in Appalachia during the 18th century, and brought with \nSettlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland the musical traditions of \nSettlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland homelands. the musical traditions of their homelands consisted primarily of English and Scottish ballads\u2014which were essentially unaccompanied narrative\u2014and dance music, such as Irish reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle. Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the British Isles. Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as \"Pretty Saro\", \"Barbara Allen\", \"Cuckoo Bird\" and \"House Carpenter\", come from the United Kingdom and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically. Others, such as The Twa Sisters, also come from the United Kingdom; however, the lyrics are about Ireland. Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as \"Leather Britches\", and \"Pretty Polly\", have Scottish roots. The dance tune Cumberland Gap may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad Bonnie George Campbell. Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in the United Kingdom there is an old ballad known as \"A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me\", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as \"I Wish My Baby Was Born\".\nIn bluegrass, as in some forms of jazz, one or more instruments each takes one or more instruments turn playing the melody and improvising around the melody, while the others perform accompaniment; this is especially typified in tunes called breakdowns. this is in contrast to old-time music, in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment. Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid tempos and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex chord changes.\nThere are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre. Traditional bluegrass has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being Bill Monroe. Progressive bluegrass groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock & roll. Examples include Cadillac Sky and Bearfoot. \"Bluegrass gospel\" has emerged as a third subgenre, which uses Christian lyrics, soulful three- or four-part harmony singing, and sometimes the playing of instrumentals. A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as The Grascals and Mountain Heart, bands from Neo-traditional bluegrass typically have more than one lead singer. Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide. Bill Monroe characterized Bluegrass music as: \"Scottish bagpipes and ole-time fiddlin'. Bluegrass music's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. Bluegrass music's blues and jazz, and Bluegrass music has a high lonesome sound.\"",

Neither of the early operas of Arnold Schoenberg (Erwartung, 1909; Die gl\u00fcckliche Hand, 1912) and his student Alban Berg (Wozzeck, 1925), both of whom adopted twelve-tone technique for their later operas: Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, and Berg\u2019s Lulu were completed in Arnold Schoenberg composers\u2019 lifetimes, however, so that the first completed opera using twelve-tone technique was Karl V (1938) by Ernst Krenek.\nAt the same time, the neoclassicism that became fashionable in the 1920s is represented by Stravinsky's opera buffa Mavra (1922) and Stravinsky's opera-oratorio Oedipus Rex (1927). Later in the century Stravinsky's last opera, The Rake's Progress (1951), also marks the end of the neoclassical phase of Stravinsky's compositions. Other operas of the century by composers identified as neoclassicists include Paul Hindemith's Mathis der Maler (1938) and Francis Poulenc's Les mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias (1945).\nThe most internationally accepted post\u2013World War II composer of operas was Englishmen Benjamin Britten (Peter Grimes, 1945; Billy Budd, 1951; The Turn of the Screw, 1954; A Midsummer Night's Dream, 1960, Death in Venice, 1973)",
