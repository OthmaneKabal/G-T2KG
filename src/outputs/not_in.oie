By following The transformation of constraint logic programs ( CLP programs ) , we encode the negation of a partial correctness property of an imperative program progas a predicate incorrect defined by a CLP program T , and we show that prog is correct by transforming a CLP program T into the empty program ( and thus incorrect does not hold ) through the application of semantics preserving transformation rules .
